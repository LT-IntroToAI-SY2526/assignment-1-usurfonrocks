# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** Python seemed much simpler than other programming languages because I feel as though there aren't as many restrictions when it comes to the actual code. It comes down a lot to logic and that is something i like in Python compared to something like java. I now feel that i have an understanding of the basics and i am proud.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** I used what we learned in the assignment where we had to learn how to prompt to actually use prompts that were gonna help give me the best answers possible. I was able to get all of the clarification i needed when trying to understand a piece of code. I would also have AI break down the code and explain specific parts when I didn't understand. Especially telling it to not give me the solution made it to where I had to actually attempt the code myself first before asking for help.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** The most challenging parts was trying to stop usin semicolon after each line. I also took a long time to figure out why a piece of code did or didn't work and then taking even more time engraving it in my head. Sometimes the AI didn't listen to me either which was pretty annoying.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** I think the best way to learn from AI is to sound like a little kid, because any time i use any sort of big word, it expects me to be some sort of expert in the topic, sometimes i would even told ai that I am a 3rd grader or something. Overall i really liked the collaborative experience and feeling like an actual partner. I always knew i could rely on the ai in the end when I had a question.
